            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>
                I recently graduated with a professional bachelor's degree in Information Systems and Software Engineering
                from the Higher School of Technology in Essaouira. Before that, I earned a university technology diploma (DUT)
                in Computer Engineering from the Higher School of Technology in Sidi Bennour. My academic background has equipped
                me with a strong foundation in web and mobile programming, database management, UML design, and computer networking.
                I am enthusiastic and passionate about the field of computer science, and I look forward to furthering my knowledge and
                skills in this ever-evolving and exciting field.
